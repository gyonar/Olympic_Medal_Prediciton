# Olympic_Medal_Prediciton
# Predicting the Number of Medals a country wins using Machine Learning
This project looks into various Python based machine learning and data science libraries in an attempt to build a machine learning model which is capable of predicting the number of medals a country wins using machine learning with reagrds to the number of atheletes representing it 

# Data:
We'll be using data from the Olympics, which was originally on Kaggle.

You can download the file we'll use in this project here:

teams.csv - the team-level data that we use in this project.

# Evaluation:
The evaluation Metric we will use is the inbuilt R-squared metric. To minimise this Coefficient of Determination is the aim of this project. We will then compare our own model with the scikit learns linear regression model

Error Metric used here is the mean absolute error
model formula= y=ax1+bx2+c

# Features:
The key fields are in team.csv are:
* team
* year
* athletes
* events
* age
* height
* weight
* prev_medals
* medals
